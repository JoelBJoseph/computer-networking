-------------------------------------------
Each step in the server program:

Socket Initialization:

	We create a socket using socket() function to enable communication over the network.

	It's initialized with the address family (AF_INET for IPv4), socket type (SOCK_STREAM for TCP), and protocol (0 for default protocol).


Error Checking:

	We check if the socket creation was successful using ssd == -1.

	If the creation fails, we print an error message and return 1 to indicate failure.


Server Address Setup:

	We initialize servaddr structure with server address and port.
	
	The address family is set to AF_INET, port to 33345, and IP address to INADDR_ANY to accept connections on any available interface.


Binding:

	We bind the server socket to the specified address and port using bind() function.

	If binding fails, we print an error message and return 1.



Listening:

	We put the server socket in the listening state using listen() function.
	
	It specifies the maximum number of queued connections as 5.
	
	If listening fails, we print an error message and return 1.


Accepting Connections:

	We accept incoming connection requests from clients using accept() function.
	
	It blocks until a client connects and returns a new socket descriptor (netSetDestination) for the connection.
	
	It also fills cliaddr with the client's address information.


Receiving Data:

	We receive data from the client using recv() function and store it in recvmsg buffer.


Processing and Displaying Data:

	We process the received data as needed.

	In this case, we simply print the received message to the console.


Closing Connections:

	We close the connection socket (netSetDestination) and the server socket (ssd) after communication is done.

Error Checking:

	We check if the socket creation was successful using csd == -1.

	If the creation fails, we print an error message.


Server Address Setup:

	We initialize servaddr structure with the server's address and port.

	The address family is set to AF_INET, port to 33345, and IP address to INADDR_LOOPBACK (loopback address representing localhost).


Connection Establishment:

	We establish a connection to the server using connect() function.
	If the connection fails, we print an error message.


Message Reading:

	We prompt the user to enter a message to be transmitted.
	We read the message from the user using fgets() function and store it in sendmsg buffer.


Message Transmission:

	We send the message stored in sendmsg buffer to the server using send() function.


Closing Connection:

	We close the client socket (csd) after the communication is done.
